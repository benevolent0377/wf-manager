# Warframe Manager

### :memo:Version: NONE

### A  non-invasive, 3rd party data parser and interface for Warframe.

*This application is not associated with Digital Extremes or Warframe and is a passion project.*

Warframe Manager is currently in development, as such, no official releases have been made as of 2025.

2. Wiki Access
3. Resource Management and Inventory Tracker
4. Warframe Market Integration
5. UI (default) and Terminal options

### Expected Full-Release Features:

These will not all be released in one update.

2. Relic interface (and Market stats as well)
3. Advanced User Statistics
    - average mission times per certain factors (mission type, level, etc.)

### Some features to ***not*** expect:
    
1. Remote account access (I.E the Warframe Companion app)
2. Account alteration by this application
     - this application will be standalone and will ***not*** interact directly with your Warframe Account
     - this app will ***not*** have access to your Warframe account
3. Access to any accounts affiliated with Warframe (you will not be asked for any credentials to other services)


## Data Collection and Privacy
    
### :warning:***DISCLAIMER***

All data on users fetched by this account will all be hosted locally on your device! None of your data will leave your device.
This will ensure that your data is safe, but it also means that there is no way to backup your data if it is lost.

***All user data is stored *locally* and *never* leaves your device.***

### How Account Data is Collected

Account data is collected non-invasively, by reading the screen using photo-recognition aswell as text-recognition to update data. Manual data updates will be allowed to correct errors encountered by the system.

### How Does My App Data Affect my Warframe Account?

It doesn't. 

All data in this application never interacts will the game itself. This app only reads and parses data for you.
